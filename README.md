## Realtime-device-track-system
This project implements a real-time device tracking map using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. The application allows users to visualize the location of devices on a map in real time, making it ideal for applications such as fleet management, delivery tracking, or personal device monitoring.

## Features
### Real-Time Location Updates: Devices send their location to the server, which broadcasts updates to all connected clients using Socket.io.
### Interactive Map: Integrates with mapping libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps to display device locations dynamically.
### Device Management: Users can add, update, and remove devices from the tracking system.
### Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across various devices.

## Technologies Used
### Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
### Express: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
### Socket.io: Enables real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and the server.
### HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for building the user interface.
### Leaflet/Google Maps: Mapping libraries for displaying the device locations.
### Getting Started
### Prerequisites

## Usage
### Adding Devices: Use the provided interface to add new devices. Each device will need a unique identifier and initial location.
### Tracking Devices: Once added, devices will send their location updates in real time, which will be reflected on the map.
### Removing Devices: Devices can be removed from the tracking system through the interface.
### Contributing: Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
### Socket.io for real-time communication.
### Leaflet or Google Maps API for mapping functionality.
### Express for simplifying server-side development.
